# godotAdventure

This is a godot experiment in third person.  It uses godot 3.5 and a character and animations from mixamo.
The character and animations are combined together in blender using the godot blender tool plugin.
This particular character required me to rotate the root_motion bone in blender to get it to move correctly with root_motion
This repo does not contain the addons folder that contains the HeightMap Terrain plugin fromn zylann.hterrain, you may have to add that for this to run

At this point in time - 1/8/2023, this is extremely basic, the character only has 3 animations and for now can only go in a straight line.
